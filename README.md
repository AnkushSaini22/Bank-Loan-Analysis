***Bank Loan Analysis***

**Project Overview**

The Loan Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower metrics. The dashboard provides insights into loan performance, regional trends, and borrower characteristics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Features and Insights

General Loan Performance Metrics

Total Loan Applications: Displays the total number of loan applications received within a specified period.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications: Compares current MTD loan applications with the previous month to track trends.

Total Funded Amount: Shows the total amount disbursed as loans.

MTD Total Funded Amount and MoM Change: Analyzes the funded amount month-over-month.

Total Amount Received from Borrowers: Tracks the total loan repayments and cash flow.

Average Interest Rate Analysis: Evaluates month-over-month changes in interest rates.

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Assesses borrower financial health over time.

**Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Analysis**

Good Loan Metrics:

Percentage of good loan applications.

Number of good loan applications received.

Total funded amount for good loans.

Total received amount for good loans.

Bad Loan Metrics:

Percentage of bad loan applications.

Number of bad loan applications received.

Total funded amount for bad loans.

Total received amount for bad loans.

**Loan Status and Trends**

Monthly Trends (Line Chart): Visualizes loan application trends over time.

Regional Analysis (Filled Map): Highlights lending activity across different states.

Loan Term Distribution (Donut Chart): Shows the distribution of loan term lengths.

Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Analyzes the impact of employment length on loan applications.

Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Categorizes loans based on purpose.

Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Examines how home ownership status affects lending.

**Power BI Implementation**

The dashboard is built using Power BI, with data extracted and processed through SQL queries. The SQL queries fetch and structure data efficiently to facilitate meaningful visual representations. The dashboard consists of:

Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by date, loan type, region, and borrower attributes.

KPI Cards: Highlights key metrics for quick insights.

Charts and Maps: Provides a visual representation of loan trends, borrower profiles, and financial health.

Grid View: Displays detailed tabular data for in-depth analysis.

**Effective Results**

By leveraging this dashboard, stakeholders can:

Identify trends and seasonality in loan applications.

Assess borrower risk through DTI and interest rate trends.

Optimize lending strategies based on regional and borrower insights.

Improve cash flow management by monitoring repayments.

**Setup and Usage**

Database Connection: Ensure SQL queries are connected to the appropriate loan database.

Power BI File: Open the Power BI dashboard file and refresh the data source.

Customization: Adjust filters and visuals as per analysis requirements.

Export Reports: Share insights with stakeholders via Power BI report export options.

**Conclusion**

The Loan Performance Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for financial analysis, helping banks and lending institutions optimize their loan portfolios through data-driven decision-making. Future enhancements may include predictive analytics and machine learning models for improved loan risk assessment.
